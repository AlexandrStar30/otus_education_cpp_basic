# otus_education_cpp_basic
Repo for education on C++ course in OTUS company


It's better to use this Repo only for education on C++ basic course.

Be careful when you will be commiting your changes in Repo! Properly composed commit will help you in future, remember it!
For more information about changes try to use the special symbols:
  /+/ - when you have added a funtionality or file;
  /-/ - when you have removed a functionality or file;
  /*/ - when you have just changed the code or file;
  /=/ - when you have made operational actions like changing the name of a file or replacing smth and etc.

Good luck in progress ♠♣♦♥
